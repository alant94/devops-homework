# Tasks

You have log file 'access.log'. It is simple nginx log. Format is 
`IP -- [DATE] "method query protocol" answer-code answer-weight-in-bytes "from-where-did-user-came" "user agent"`

## Awk
* What is the most frequent browser (user agent)?

` awk command that solves this task`

* Show number of requests per month for ip 95.108.129.196 (for example: Sep 2016 - 100500 reqs, Oct 2016 - 0 reqs, Nov 2016 - 2 reqs...)
* Show total amount of data which server has provided for each unique ip (i.e. 100500 bytes for 1.2.3.4; 9001 bytes for 5.4.3.2 and so on)

## Sed
* Change all user agents to "lynx"
* Masquerade all ip addresses. For example, 1.2.3.4 becomes "ip1", 3.4.5.6 becomse "ip2" and so on. Rewrite file.

## Extra
* Show list of unique ips, who made more then 50 requests to the same url within 10 minutes (for example too many requests to "/")
